# 972b
This is a driver library for the 972b Vacuum Pressure Transducer. 

Place the 972b library folder in your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder. You may need to create a library subfolder if you are including your first library. Then you should restart the IDE.

Here is a helpful [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-all-about-arduino-libraries-install-use/how-to-install-a-library) to install libraries manually or by using the library manager.

The full operation and installation manual for the 972b transducer can be found here: [www.lesker.com/newweb/gauges/pdf/manuals/12-058_972manual.pdf](https://www.lesker.com/newweb/gauges/pdf/manuals/12-058_972manual.pdf)
